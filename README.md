# dndbot
A personalized bot for my D&amp;D server!

How to Use:
Get the list of commands from the /helpme command!
In addition, you can invoke any command by either using the '/' prefix, or by mentioning the bot itself! 
So, both '/helpme' and '@dndbot#2832 helpme' work!

Current Features:
- Roll Command: using the command format "\[botmention] roll \[amount of dice]d\[amount of sides each individual die has]," the bot will roll 
    however many dice of however many sides you like, up to a maximum of 500 dice. The bot will then show the sum of the die rolls!
    If you're rolling d20s, the bot also tells you how many critical successes and/or failures you rolled.
- #the-stat channel: Secret feature, only works on my server
- 'spell' command: using the 'spell' command, the bot will lookup the specified spell using the 'dnd5eapi.co' API, and output all the information about the specified spell to the channel.
- scheduling command: this command creates a tool that allows DMs to track which players are available for specific times! Players can indicate whether they can make it in-person, online, if they can't make it, or even if they might be able to make it, but they're unsure. 
- Weapon Tracker Suite: this set of commands allows each player to track and store their weapons in-game, so they can retreive that info on the fly. In addition, you can use the /rolldamage \[weapon name] to roll a weapon's damage dice easily! 
- Cloud Deployment: This bot currently is deployed on a remote cloud server so that it is always online. 
- More features will come as soon as I can think of them.
